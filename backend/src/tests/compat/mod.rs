//! API compatibility tests.
//!
//! These tests verify that the server and daemon can handle requests from
//! different versions, ensuring backwards compatibility.
//!
//! ## Fixture Generation
//!
//! Fixtures are automatically captured during integration tests when running
//! with `--features generate-fixtures`:
//!
//! - `daemon_to_server.json`: Requests the daemon makes to the server
//! - `server_to_daemon.json`: Requests the server makes to the daemon
//! - `openapi.json`: OpenAPI spec for schema validation
//!
//! ## Replay Testing
//!
//! Replay tests load fixtures and make actual HTTP requests to verify
//! compatibility. IDs in paths and bodies are substituted with test values.
//! Response bodies are validated against the captured OpenAPI schema.
